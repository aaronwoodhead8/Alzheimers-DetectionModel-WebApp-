# Alzheimers-DetectionModel-WebApp
This is my Dissertation project I developed when studying at Norhtumbria Uni.

This web application uses a sequential deep learning model, capable of multi class classification of the different stages of Alzheimers disease.

To view the DissertationModel.ipynb correclty use jupyter notebooks.

Run testDissNew2 using these commands in miniconda3;

pip install streamlit 

conda env list 

cd C:\Users\aaron\OneDrive\Documents\DissertationHandIn\CODE "put your file path here"

streamlit run testDissNew2.py

This will work only if the user has the correct packages installed in their console such as Tensorflow, cv2, numpy.

When you are on the web app, download the TestImagesViva and use them to test out the functionallity of the application.
